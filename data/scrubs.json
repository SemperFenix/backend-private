Despite his often immature behavior, he shows little patience when he finds his colleagues goofing off: \u0022The medical interns are having a Pac Man tournament. Apparently we\u0027re all 12.\u0022 But with his wit and work ethic, he\u0027ll likely find a way to succeed at Sacred Heart and in life."
